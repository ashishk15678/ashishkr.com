## Technical Blog — Recent Posts

### Exploiting Virtual Memory: Tricks Every Systems Programmer Should Know
- **URL:** https://ashishkr.com/posts/exploiting-virtual-memory-tricks-every-systems-programmer-should-know
- **Published:** February 25, 2026
- **Topics:** Virtual memory internals, page tables, mmap, copy-on-write, zero-copy I/O, guard pages, userfaultfd, huge pages, demand paging, TLB optimization.
- **Summary:** A deep exploration of virtual memory internals — from page table manipulation and mmap tricks to copy-on-write exploits and zero-copy I/O patterns that can 10x your program's performance. Covers practical C code for lazy allocation, COW snapshots (as used by Redis BGSAVE), sendfile/splice zero-copy, mprotect guard pages, userfaultfd for userspace page fault handling, and huge page allocation for TLB pressure reduction.

### Writing a Memory Allocator from Scratch in C
- **URL:** https://ashishkr.com/posts/writing-a-memory-allocator-from-scratch
- **Published:** February 18, 2026
- **Topics:** Memory allocation, malloc/free implementation, free lists, block splitting, coalescing, alignment, sbrk, mmap, external fragmentation, per-thread arenas.
- **Summary:** Step-by-step construction of a production-quality memory allocator — covering block headers, free-list management with first-fit search, block splitting to avoid waste, coalescing of adjacent free blocks to combat fragmentation, proper 16-byte alignment, thread safety with mutexes, and calloc/realloc implementations. Compares against production allocators like jemalloc, tcmalloc, and mimalloc.

### Inline Assembly and Compiler Intrinsics: When C Isn't Fast Enough
- **URL:** https://ashishkr.com/posts/inline-assembly-and-compiler-intrinsics-for-performance
- **Published:** February 10, 2026
- **Topics:** GCC extended inline assembly, x86-64 assembly, SIMD/AVX2 intrinsics, compiler built-ins, POPCNT, CRC32C, memory fences, lock-free programming, rdtsc, cmpxchg.
- **Summary:** Practical guide to using GCC/Clang inline assembly, SIMD intrinsics, and compiler built-ins to extract every last cycle from modern hardware. Covers the asm constraint system, hardware popcount (47x speedup), AVX2 memchr replacement (8x faster), SIMD string-to-uppercase, memory fence instructions for lock-free code, hardware CRC32C acceleration (15x speedup), and guidelines for when to use (and not use) inline assembly.

## Technical Stack
