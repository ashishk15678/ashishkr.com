6:T8d8,<p>I've been the first engineer at three startups. Each one taught me something different about building products under pressure.</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Ship First, Optimize Later</h2>
<p>At my first startup, we spent 3 months building a "scalable" architecture for an app that had zero users. We ran out of runway before finding product-market fit.</p>
<p>The fix: Build the simplest thing that could work. You can always refactor when you have users and revenue. I now use this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're not embarrassed by v1, you shipped too late.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Lesson 2: Technical Debt Is a Business Decision</h2>
<p>Not all debt is bad. Taking on technical debt to ship faster can be the right call—if you're intentional about it.</p>
<p>What I track:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Known shortcuts</strong> - Document them in code comments</li>
<li><strong>Future cost</strong> - Rough estimate of cleanup time</li>
<li><strong>Trigger for payback</strong> - "Refactor when we hit X users"</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is making debt visible and planned, not accidental.</p>
<h2>Lesson 3: Communication Scales Harder Than Code</h2>
<p>With 3 engineers, everyone knows everything. With 15, you need processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RFCs for big decisions</strong> - Write it down, get async feedback</li>
<li><strong>Runbooks for operations</strong> - Because 3 AM incidents happen</li>
<li><strong>Architecture decision records</strong> - Future you will thank past you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 4: Hire for Slope, Not Intercept</h2>
<p>The best hires I've made were people who learned fast, not people who already knew everything. In a startup, the problems change every quarter. Adaptability beats expertise.</p>
<h2>Lesson 5: Your First Architecture Will Be Wrong</h2>
<p>Accept it. Plan for it. Make it easy to change things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep services loosely coupled</li>
<li>Use feature flags for new functionality</li>
<li>Design databases for migration, not permanence</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Meta-Lesson</h2>
<p>Startups are about learning fast. Every technical decision should optimize for speed of learning, not perfection. Perfect code that ships too late helps no one.</p>
<p>What matters: solving real problems for real users, as quickly as possible.</p>
